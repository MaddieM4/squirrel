Trying to form an overall vision here:

 [X] SQL Snippet (replaces Inspection and, conceptually, Raw)
 [X] SQL Chains
 [X] Format/template constructor for SQL Chains
 [ ] Convenience helpers
   [X] SELECT
   [X] AND
   [X] OR
   [X] WHERE
     [X] args
     [X] kwargs
     [X] IN [iterable]
   [ ] JOIN
   [ ] GROUP BY
   [ ] ORDER BY
   [ ] LIMIT
   [ ] fn.ANYTHING
   [ ] fn.ANYTHING(AS=...)
[ ] Query builder
[ ] Operator support
