Trying to form an overall vision here:

 [X] SQL Snippet (replaces Inspection and, conceptually, Raw)
 [X] SQL Chains
 [ ] Format/template constructor for SQL Chains
 [ ] Convenience helpers
   [ ] SELECT
   [ ] WHERE
     [ ] args
     [ ] kwargs
     [ ] IN [iterable]
   [ ] JOIN
   [ ] GROUP BY
   [ ] ORDER BY
   [ ] LIMIT
   [ ] fn.ANYTHING
   [ ] fn.ANYTHING(AS=...)
[ ] Query builder
[ ] Operator support
