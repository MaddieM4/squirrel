 [X] SQL Chains
 [X] Format/template constructor for SQL Chains
 [ ] Convenience helpers
   [X] SELECT
   [X] AND
   [X] OR
   [X] WHERE
     [X] args
     [X] kwargs
     [X] IN [iterable]
   [X] JOIN
     [X] Inspection support for [list]s
     [X] Support ident == ('<', value)
     [X] inner/outer separation, where outer function does "parsing", and inner function has rigid interface
   [X] GROUP BY
   [X] ORDER BY
   [X] LIMIT
   [X] OFFSET
   [X] fn.ANYTHING
   [X] fn.ANYTHING(AS=...)
[ ] Query builder
[ ] Operator support (more detail)
